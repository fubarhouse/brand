A **developer-centric experience** in creating and managing Drupal 7 sub-sites through the use of theme management.

**This is essentially a much fancier version of [ThemeKey](https://www.drupal.org/project/themekey)**

## Introduction

This module serves as a practical, managed solution to organisations needing to handle 'snowflakes' and 'unicorns'.

## Requirements

None.

## Installation

Installation is standard for Drupal 7 modules.

See https://drupal.org/documentation/install/modules-themes/modules-7 for more information.

## Configuration

* Under the administrative options for User Interface, find the link to the Brand module.
* If there are no brands, you can add a new brand using the link above the table, or at the top of the page.
* Follow the prompts, filling out the fields as required.
  Detailed information is available next to the form fields.
* After submitting the form, it's recommended to clear caches - especially if you're expecting anonymous traffic.

## Troubleshooting

* Issues and PR's are more than welcome, but please do so if you can produce replicable results.
