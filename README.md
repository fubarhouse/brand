An enhanced version of [ThemeKey](https://www.drupal.org/project/themekey) which is forcused towards being a **developer-centric experience**.

## Introduction

This module serves as a practical, managed solution designed specifically for organisations needing to handle 'snowflakes' and 'unicorns' with a simple, powerful and scalable system for theme control.

## Requirements

None.

## Installation

Installation is [standard](https://drupal.org/documentation/install/modules-themes/modules-7) for Drupal 7 modules.

## Configuration

* After installation, allocate permissions as required.
* Determine if theme controls need to be disabled. If you do not do this, themes will not be available to you when creating Brands.
* If applicable, add the themes to the available theme list or disable the theme control on the settings form.
* Under the menu for User Interface, find the link to the Brand module.
* If there are no brands, you can add a new brand using the link above the table, or at the top of the page.
* Follow the prompts, filling out the fields as required.

## Troubleshooting

* Issues and PR's are more than welcome, but please do so if you can produce replicable results.
